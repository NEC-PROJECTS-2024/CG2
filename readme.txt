### Team Details :
    1. Vyshnavi Bobbala
    2. Kalpana Surasani
    3. Aswini Kancharla
### INTRODUCTION
Created deepfake detection using RNN and Inception V3 with Mobile Net. Also developed a CNN-based face mask identification system with ImageNet. These projects contribute to fighting misinformation and improving public health measures.
